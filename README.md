This repository contains the source codes used in the paper:

MapReduce-Based Maximum-Flow Algorithm for Large Small-World Network Graph


See the overview, demo, paper, and slides at:

Note: this repo is not intended to be runnable. There are a lot of configuration files and tuning needed to run this code.
It is far better to learn what these codes are doing and then implement your own in the latest version of Hadoop or other Map Reduce platforms.
It will take months to do so, but you will learn far more effectively that way.
